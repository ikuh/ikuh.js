# HTML5/JavaScript implementation of iKuh

We implemented an HTML5/JavaScript version of ikuh for the clay.io Got Game? competition.

[The Github pages page for this repository contains the last build of the competition with all levels unlocked from the start.](http://ikuh.github.io/ikuh.js/)

Originally the HTML5/JavaScript version was [available at clay.io](https://ikuh.clay.io/game/ikuh), but it seems they require a login now.

The original iKuh desktop version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ikuh/ikuh.desktop).
